Carbomb is one of my guilty pleasures.
Why guilty? Because their music feels like it’s encrypted because someone is trying to stop you from listening.
You throw all your brainpower at it and still can’t catch everything that’s going on.
It’s almost comically complex and I love it.

That’s why I was so hyped to finally see them live.
Watching them pull it off so effortlessly absolutely made my day.
Huge thanks for playing at BA! `\m/`
