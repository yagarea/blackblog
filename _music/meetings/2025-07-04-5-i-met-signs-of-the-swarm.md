This was my first Fajtfest ever.
I didn’t know what to expect — but that’s part of the adventure.
After I arrived, I checked out the venue and bought a drink.


Then, by a strike of pure luck, I found myself standing next to Dave. The Dave. **DAVID FUCKING SIMONICH!**
He looked a bit bored, so I asked if he wanted to chat — and he agreed.
Later, I found out he was thinking about getting a haircut right there at the festival.
We spent around 30 minutes talking about his creative process, life on tour, and relationships with former band members.
It was amazing. After seeing them live twice and spending thousands of hours listening to his voice on record,
I finally got to know him in person.

Thanks, Dave, for the great chat. It meant a lot. And the haircut turned out dope btw.

Later that day, I had the opportunity to meet the rest of the band. Thank you, guys, for the art you bring into this world. I don’t even need to say that they absolutely [killed that evening’s show](/music/5-signs-of-the-swarm-defamed-2025-07-04/#signs-of-the-swarm). `\m/`
