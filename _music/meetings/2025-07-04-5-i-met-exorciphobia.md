After the [Exorcipobia show](/music/1-inveins-hot-sunday-blood-exorciphobia-2025-07-04/#exorciphobia),
I went to buy a drink and saw one of the band members packing up merch at the merch shop.
I asked if he needed any help, and he said yes. I helped move boxes of merch to the van.
Then I asked if I could take a picture with the band, and he agreed.

After meeting the band we took a picture and had a chat.

I am glad that I had a chance to see this band and that there are still bands
from my own country left to discover. `\m/`
