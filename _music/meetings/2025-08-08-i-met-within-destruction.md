I remember when Deathwish dropped and I instantly fell in love with it.
I really miss that slamming deathcore era...
When Within Destruction switched to "weebcore," I kinda lost interest in their new stuff.
But years later, they popped up on Slav Metal 2 by Nik Nocturnal,
so I gave them another shot—and I’m glad I did!

The guitarist, Howard Fang, completely stole the show.
Dude was shredding chunky riffs while literally running in the circle pit with the crowd.
The world needs madmen like this. Thanks for existing. `\m/`
