Project made in cooperation with [Niantic labs](https://nianticlabs.com/).
It was robotic Ingress portal. It reacted real time to the players in game and real life.
At the top of portal is holographic display projecting eye.
Eye was programmed to look at players standing near by and changing color based on the state of portal it self.
