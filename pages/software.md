This is list of subset of software I use. I do not optimize on aesthetics or how "cool" or written in rust
it is. I prioritize minimalist software which is comfy to use so I can be effective and understand what is
happening in my machines.

**Operating system**
: **[Arch linux](https://archlinux.org/)** - Rolling release [linux](https://kernel.org/) distribution
  with [SystemD](https://systemd.io/) init system. I like it for its simplicity. If you are linux wizard
  you should go for something like [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) or [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

**Window manager**
: **[Sway](https://swaywm.org/)** [[MIT](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/LICENSE)] -
  i3-compatible Wayland compositor based on [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/).
  I have perfected my configuration years on [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) and have been using it since.

**Terminal**
: **[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)** [[Appache 2.0](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE)] -
  Highly configurable GPU accelerated terminal emulator. I use [branch with sixel support](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/4763).

**Shell**
: **[Fish](https://fishshell.com/)** [[GPLv2](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme)] -
  Very interactive command line shell. Very easy to script and use. It is not POSIX compliant.

**Text editor**
: **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** [[Apache 2.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme)] -
  Modern implementation of legendary text editor [vim](https://www.vim.org/). It has no real competition.
  It is most effective way to work with text by far.

**Web browser**
: **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)** [[MPL 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/)] -
  I use highly customized version of firefox with custom user CSS, user scripts and add-ons.
  [I have documented my setup](/firefox-customization/).

**File manager**
: **[Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)** [[GPLv3](https://github.com/ranger/ranger?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme)] -
  Great TUI file manager written in python. It is highly configurable and has a lot of plugins.
