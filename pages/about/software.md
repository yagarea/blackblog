This is list of subset of software I use. I do not optimize on aesthetics or how "cool" or written in rust
it is. I prioritize minimalist software which is comfy to use so I can be effective and understand what is
happening in my machines.

**Operating system**
: **[Arch linux](https://archlinux.org/)** - Rolling release [linux](https://kernel.org/) distribution
  with [SystemD](https://systemd.io/) init system. I like it for its simplicity. If you are linux wizard
  you should go for something like [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) or [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).
