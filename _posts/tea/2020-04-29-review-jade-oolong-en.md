EyeDryLeaf: "The leaves are rolled into the shape and size of allspice. Most of their surface is dark swamp green with light green spots. Sometimes a piece of light brown petiole sticks out. The vacuum in packaging caused wrinkling. The balls almost look like their were kneaded."
NoseDryLeaf: "You will probably be surprised as much as I am, but the smell of this tea reminded me most of cornflakes and rice cakes accompanied by the smell of peony or coltsfoot. Pleasant sweet scent."
NoseWetLeaf: "Very disparate and rich scent. It is very difficult to name something specific in it. I would compare it most closely to a late summer walk in a meadow where hay dries. There is also the smell of fresh white bread. The tones of the coltsfoot and peony are also stronger."

EyeLiquor: "Almost pastel yellow. Like a lemon or dandelion but very light almost faded."
MouthTexture: "Light and watery. Very refreshing."
MouthTaste: "Mostly ginseng. Very earthy and mineral, but still vegetal taste. Also umami and dill traces. Very full taste."

MouthFinish: "Ginseng again, this time accompanied by daisies."
NoseEmptyCup: "Over the aroma of peoniese is wins the aroma of freshly sliced pumpkin."
EyeWetLeaf: "The leaves unwrapped and filled the teapot to the brim."

conclusion: "Great tea for all-day drinking. Definitely worth a try. I recommend this tea to anyone who appreciates the strong taste without bitterness.

This tea has interesting origin. It was grown in the style of *Natural Farming* which stands for farming in harmony with the surrounding nature without the use of artificial fertilizers or pesticides. And that's a huge plus.
