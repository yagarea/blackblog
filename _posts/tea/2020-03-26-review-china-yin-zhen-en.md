EyeDryLeaf: "Canoe-shaped long narrow leaves. Velvet surface. Pale light green leaves. 
Light gray hairs from one side."
EyeWetLeaf: "The leaves fot much larger. The hairs are no longer visible. The leaves 
opened and became hazy green." 
EyeLiquor: "Very light beige."

NoseDryLeaf: "Dry wood and hay. Like a walk through the mowed meadow in late summer."
NoseWetLeaf: "Dried apricots and dried flowers. Very strong and pleasant aroma."
NoseEmptyCup: "Oily fruity aroma. Closest to the smell of freshly cut peaches."

MouthTexture: "Creamy, slightly oily."
MouthTaste: "Delicate grassy taste. Very light. Light wood and bitter tones. 
Also a little bit of taste of walnuts."
MouthFinish: "Astrigent and bitter aftertaste."

conclusion: "Definitely a very interesting tea. I appreciate its very strong and 
pleasant aroma which filled the whole room. The taste was very light and refreshing. 
The bitterly astrigent end was a little disturbing. It is a pity, because otherwise 
it is an excellent tea. The imperfections are small, but they should not be in this 
price range."

I bought this tea when I was in Heidelberg. There was a small tea shop right next to 
the magnificent building of the famous university. Of course I had to visit it. 
One of the teas I bought there is this one.
