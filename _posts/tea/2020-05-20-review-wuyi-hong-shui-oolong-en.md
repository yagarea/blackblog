EyeDryLeaf: "The cake is 13cm in diameter, is 1cm high and weights 100g. 
The leafs are laid parallel to each other. They have various shades of green and seem 
to be similar to the <a href='https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-wr7YQE1mgU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1'>pattern 95 used by the Czech army</a>. 
The pieces of long brown twigs will surely catch your attention. 
The disc is very hard and the fine dust crumbles from it."

EyeWetLeaf: "The twig pieces darkened. The leafs are tattered from breaking off of 
the disc. The amount of the trash increased, it has absorbed some of the water and 
adhered to the inside parts of the tea pod."
EyeLiquor: "If you look at this tea for the first time, you might think it is an apple 
juice. But if you look at it closely, you will find out that it contains small 
particles that come from the leafs. Even though you can't see the particles with your 
naked eye, they don't disturb you when drinking the tea. With the increasing number of 
the brews the color turns into green with golden shadows."

NoseDryLeaf: "Aroma of almonds in candy. Very sweet scent of nuts and caramel."
NoseWetLeaf: "Scented with puffed rice. I also recognize butter biscuits."
NoseEmptyCup: "Weaker version of dry leaver aroma."

MouthTexture: "Silk fine texture. Incomparason with this texture is graphen ..."
MouthTaste: "The taste of anise is accompanied by a fresh vegetal taste, typical of Taiwanese oolongs. The taste is very full and strong. At the same time, it does not contain any bitterness."
MouthFinish: "Heavy going taste of spice. It goes grat with flavor of the brew."

conclusion: "At first I would recommend to start with lower temperatures than is 
recommended by distributor. It is best to start at 80°C and slightly increase 
temperature with every brew.

Otherwise, as for the tea itself, I am proud to announce that I have found a tea gem. 
A very balanced and full tea that reigns supreme with all the oolongs in my tea box."

rating: "9.5"

This tea is my first experience with pressed tea outside of tea house. I was really 
looking forward for this tea. I am very happy that it's time has come.

_This review is for my friend Robin who helped me find the way in to the tea store._
