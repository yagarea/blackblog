EyeDryLeaf: "Visually interesting fine heterogeneous mixture. Contains small leafs 
with petioles. The leaves have a wide range of shades from green to brown to gray. 
There are also small tips with yellow hairs. Rarely can be found pieces of fine twigs."
EyeWetLeaf: "The leaves unfolded. Sawtooth edges are clearly visible. The colors of 
the leafs are more unified. The veins were greatly emphasized. Overall the leaves look 
like freshly picked."
EyeLiquor: "Honey amber color. Very warm shade. Like the hair of a young beautiful 
redhead in the sunshine."

NoseDryLeaf: "Very sweet aroma. There are notes of raisins, cabernet wines, barley 
malt and dried rose petals."
NoseWetLeaf: "Aroma is very highlighted. Pouring through rowans, maple syrup, red wine. 
It also reminds of smell when cutting fresh deciduous wood."
NoseEmptyCup: "Cane sugar. Light cigar. Freshly baked honey cake."

MouthTexture: "Pleasantly rough. Heavily milky."
MouthTaste: "Powerful rich flavor. Very warm and bright. The taste of fine tobacco and 
quality old wisky matured in wooden barrels. There are also tones of smoke from burning 
fresh wood. The flavor of freshly roasted coffee and decent minerality are also 
showing themself."
MouthFinish: "Wooden tannin with coffee taste. Pleasant and long lasting."

conclusion: "I am very pleased with this tea. Very rich taste and beautiful aroma. 
It is very similar to teas from northern Darjeeling but the higher altitude has 
increased its intensity. Gold tips have a great share in the taste which refreshes tea 
very much. It is obvious that it is result of high quality and gentle processing. 
It is the best black tea I've tried in some time."

Every time I end my lesson at Protestant Theological Faculty of Charles Unicersity 
I go by small cozy shop. When you enter it you will see tables full of tins with tea 
and behind the cash register a young pretty disheveled lady with big glasses. I always 
buy diferent tea there hoping to come across some tea gem. This review will be about 
one of the candidates.
